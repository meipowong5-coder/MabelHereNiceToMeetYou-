                    the upper or bottom half of an inverted area depends on the area has been flipped horizontally or

                    analyze() to check the loudness which would aﬀect the value of noise together with the position and
                    the opacity of pattern C. The length of patterns C and B, and the distance between the ellipses and
                    the center in pattern A would be adjusted by the amplitude too. I set the ﬀt to calculate the
                    frequency of sound and save the data in the spectrum. The data would be shown through the size of
                    the circles in pattern A. Therefore, the visual elements are all based on the data received from the
                    sound and the user could press the space bar to remove the fading eﬀect to create a mesh, magic

                    beat of songs, but they look like attacks from aliens too. Pressing the button when the combo
                    arrives the circles at the bottom somehow looks like blocking their attacks and defending the player

                <div class="work-desc">In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of
                    anxiety and its impact on individuals and society as a whole. The heightened awareness of anxiety
                    issues has inspired us to take action and find ways to address these challenges. We have developed a
                    comprehensive system to address the issue of anxiety by implementing various features and
                    techniques. Through extensive research, we have gained insights into anxiety and effective methods
                    for managing it.
